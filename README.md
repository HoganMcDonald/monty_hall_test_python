# monty_hall_test_python
A statistical simulation of the monty hall problem.

I watched a video on the Monty Hall problem by vox and decided to create a python script to test possible answers. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggDQXlinbME) video explains it much better than I could in a readme. 

This script will generate a random set of guesses given a population size, then will either generate a set of random switched guesses or just the initial set and return ultimately the success percentage. variables are easy to configure, which makes it easy to compare very large populations for increased statistical accuracy.
